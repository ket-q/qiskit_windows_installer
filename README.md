##  üìç What is QIWI ?

QIWI, the **Q**iskit **I**nstaller for **WI**ndows, will set up Qiskit and a local copy of Visual Studio Code (VS Code) on your computer, with a ready-to-use Python virtual environment for Jupyter notebooks. After the installation, a Jupyter notebook
walks the user through the initial setup on the IBM Quantum Platform.

<br />

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notices Before Using QIWI

- Only install software on a computer that is not production-level or mission-critical to you. (This is a general truth that does not pertain only to this installer.)

- You are recommended to install Qiskit in a **fresh user account** on your computer.
  - This will help insulate your Qiskit SDK from other software you may have already installed on your computer, particularly if your computer already has a complicated software installation history.
  - Please refer to this [tutorial video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpPZ1oBjsnM) on how to create a fresh user account.
  - Please log in under this account to install Qiskit.
  - **Note:** if you forego to create a fresh user account, there is still a very
    high likelyhood for your installation to succeed. But you effectively omit one
    safety-net to safe-guard your existing computer configuration and insulate
    the Qiskit environment from software already installed on your computer. 

- Installation requirements for using QIWI:

  - Windows 11 or Windows 10 on the x86 platform
  - At least 4GB of free disk space
  - PowerShell 5.1 (comes pre-installed with both Windows 11 and 10)

<br />

### üèÉ Running the script !   


- **Method 1:** (recommended if you're ok with downloading and executing an executable on your computer):

  - Download and execute qiskit_installer.exe ([click here](https://github.com/ket-q/qiskit_windows_installer_pub/raw/refs/heads/main/qiskit_installer.exe)).
  - Windows may present you with a security warning in a blue box because it considers the installer as a security thread. To proceed with the installation,
  please click on "More informations" and "Execute anyway".



  
- **Method 2:** (if you want visibility into the script you will execute on your computer): Run the provided installation script with Windows PowerShell.

  **Step 1**: Open a PowerShell console window
  - Type ``PowerShell`` in the search bar and click ``Windows PowerShell`` (the blue square with the white > prompt).  

   **Step 2:** Copy the following command into the clipboard (by clicking
   on the square symbol in the right corner):
  
  ```powershell
  Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; if($?) { irm "https://github.com/ket-q/qiskit_windows_installer/raw/refs/heads/main/qiskit_installer.ps1" | iex}
  ```


  **Step 3:** Paste the command from the clipboard into

the setup of your API token for the IBM Quantum Platform.

#### Step 3Ô∏è‚É£: Step 3: Follow the step-by-step guide to run Jupyter notebooks and get started on the IBM Quantum Platform. 

This Jupyter notebok includes:
- Selecting a Python interpreter for your Jupyter notebook
- Adding your IBM Quantum API token to the Qiskit installation on your
  local computer. 


*You can also download the setup [notebook](https://github.com/ket-q/qiskit_windows_installer/blob/main/resources/notebook/IBM_account_setup.ipynb) manually. Click on "download raw file" button next to the pen (top-right)*

#### Step 4Ô∏è‚É£ (Optional): We recommended to save this setup notebook in a folder where you keep your quantum computing projects
