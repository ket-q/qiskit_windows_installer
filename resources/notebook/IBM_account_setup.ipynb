    " 1. In the top-right corner of the notebook window, click on \"Select Kernel\"\n",
    "\n",
    " 2. Click on \"Python Environments...\"\n",

    " 3. In the drop-down list, select the Python environment name that starts with ``qiskit_``, followed by the Qiskit version you chose during installation.\n",
    "    - Example: If during installation you chose version 1.4.2, your Python environment name will be ``qiskit_1_4_2``.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - **Note:** It is **essential** to select the **correct** Python environment. VS Code may offer several alternative Python environments to you, but only the one starting with ``qiskit_`` contains your Qiskit installation.\n",

    "authenticate to the IBM Quantum Platform.\n",
    "This is more convenient than manually copy-pasting your API token into every Jupyter notebook that requires access to the IBM Quantum Platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Please note:** For security reasons you should never share your token or a Jupyter notebook or Python code that contains your token. For the same reason you should not store your IBM Quantum Platform API token on a public computer such as a lab PC.\n",

    "   - In the top-right corner of the dashboard, you find a box titled ``**Create API KEY**''.\n",
    "2. In the API Token box, enter a name for your API key and please click on the square symbol to copy your API\n",
    "  token to the clipboard.\n",
    "   - Return back to this VS Code window.  \n",
    "3. In the Jupyter notebook cell below, **replace the text \"PASTE_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE\"**  by your\n",

    "   - Delete the text \"PASTE_YOUR_TOKEN_HERE\", but keep the quotes(\"\").\n",
    "   - Place your curser between the quotes and then press CTRL + V to paste your API token.\n",
    "   - Your token should now look similar to \"a2aeae5ad48986d4adadcd5f48z4f8zf4q8fds6fsddaudazd54dd7dz49ad69ad\"\n",

    "   - Click on the button create instance of your dashboard\n",
    "   - Name your instance and select your pricing plan\n",
    "   - Finish the setup\n",
    "   - Copy the CRN KEY (you can find it in the dashboard)\n",
